## Me in a few words

I am Adrien Anthore ; 2nd year Master's student at the Paris Observatory - PSL ; President of BDE de l'Observatoire de Paris (student council) ; Content creator for L'Observatoire d'Adrien.

## Bio

I'm Adrien Anthore, an astrophysics student and amateur astronomer. I graduated from the intensive physics track at Sorbonne University (2022), **SPRINT** (Sorbonne Physics Research Intensive and New Technologies), and will soon graduate from the Astrophysics graduate program at the Paris Observatory - PSL (2024), in **IRT** (International Research Track) major Observational Astrophysics.

Since 2020, I have been actively involved in science communication and popularization. I am committed to sharing my knowledge and raising awareness among the general public about the importance of scientific research and its challenges. In this spirit, I created the [**L'Observatoire d'Adrien**](https://linktr.ee/lobservatoiredadrien) program, a program to popularize astrophysics topics on the Internet. In addition to my online activity, I regularly participate in scientific conventions or festivals open to the general public as a speaker, such as the Explor'Espace festival in 2021 or the "FÃªte de la Science" in universities since 2022. I also intervene in the school environment, mainly to discuss scientific studies and career prospects.
