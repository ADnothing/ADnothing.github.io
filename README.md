## Me in a few words

I am Adrien Anthore; 2nd year Master's student at the Paris Observatory - PSL; President of BDE de l'Observatoire de Paris (student council); Content creator for L'Observatoire d'Adrien; Amateur astronomer.

## Bio

I'm Adrien Anthore, an astrophysics student and amateur astronomer. I graduated from the intensive physics track at Sorbonne University (2022), **SPRINT** (Sorbonne Physics Research Intensive and New Technologies), and will soon graduate from the Astrophysics graduate program at the Paris Observatory - PSL (2024), in **IRT** (International Research Track) major Observational Astrophysics.

Since 2021, I have been actively involved in science communication and popularization. I am committed to sharing my knowledge and raising awareness among the general public about the importance of scientific research and its challenges. In this spirit, I created the program: [**L'Observatoire d'Adrien**](https://linktr.ee/lobservatoiredadrien), a program to popularize astrophysics topics on the Internet. In addition to my online activity, I regularly participate in scientific conventions or festivals open to the general public as a speaker, such as the Explor'Espace festival in 2021 or the "FÃªte de la Science" in universities since 2022. I also intervene in the school environment, mainly to discuss scientific studies and career prospects.

When I was a kid, I discovered astronomy through books and observing the stars at night.
I wanted to persevere in the observations, first using binoculars to observe the Moon and the planets.
Then I started buying instruments to observe more and more objects.
Today, I have a 200/1200 Dobson, a 70/700 refractor, and an electronically-assisted device.
The pictures I take come mostly from my EA device, but also from lucky imaging.
I also perform observational drawings.
