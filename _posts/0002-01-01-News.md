**Ongoing**: I'm on holiday, which means it might take me a while to answer, sorry in advance.

**IMPORTANT**: I am looking for a PhD position, I'm an expert in observational astrophysics and have advanced Machine Learning skills.
I also have a solid knowledge of instrumentation, HPC/PDA, and GPU computing.
Regarding astrophysical applications, I am an expert in galaxies in general and radio astronomy.
If you are looking for a student, or know a position that could fit my skills, don't hesitate to get in touch with me [here](mailto:adrien.anthore@gmail.com?subject=[Academic%20Opportunity])!
