## Automatic detection of the HI gas line in massive data from pre-Square Kilometre Array surveys

- **Object of study**: galaxies (HI 21 cm emission line);  
  
- **Method**: Deep Learning (detection and characterization);  
  
- **Data**: Big Data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) precursors/pathfinders (MeerKAT, ASKAP, LOFAR, ...);  

**Goal**: produce high-confidence detection catalogues, confirm candidates, eventually statistically and physically analyze the detections.
