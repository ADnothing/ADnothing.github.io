### Description

In 2021, I created L'Observatoire d'Adrien, a science popularization program on the internet. 
The goal of this initiative was to be able to communicate and transmit my knowledge and my passion to the general public. 
I first started with YouTube, then I grew my audience with TikTok and Instagram. 
Today, I make videos about physics in general, Astronomy/Astrophysics, and scientific research.
