## L'Observatoire d'Adrien

### Description

In 2021, I created "L'Observatoire d'Adrien", a programme to popularise science on the Internet. 
The aim of this initiative is to communicate and share my knowledge and passion with the general public. 
I started with YouTube and then expanded my audience and activities with TikTok and Instagram. 
Today I make videos about physics in general, astronomy/astrophysics and scientific research.

### YouTube (French content)

On my YouTube channel you will find popularised videos on astronomy and astrophysics, but also some basic elements of physics. 
The target audience is the general public, the youngest and the oldest, the most and the least informed.

### Instagram (French content)

On my Instagram account you will find three types of content:
* Publications, occasional photos of my observations or my various activities that showcase my work and my scientific engagement;
* Reels, short occasional entertainment videos about my daily life or activities;
* Stories, daily ephemeral photos or videos documenting my life at work.

### TikTok (English content)

I regularly post videos on my TikTok account to interact with the community.
I do a bit of popularisation on various astrophysical topics and I enrich my content thanks to questions and interactions from the public.
I also post some entertaining videos, always related to astronomy and astrophysics. 
I have chosen to produce all my content in English with French subtitles in order to widen my audience as much as possible, taking advantage of the accessibility of the content that the platform offers.

The "Fête de la Science" is an annual French event that takes place every year during one week in October.
Since 2022, I often take part as an animator.
In 2022, I participated with the student organisation Top Aéro at the Sorbonne University.
I presented the organisation's aeronautics and space projects to the general public.
In 2023 and 2024, I participated with the Paris Observatory. 
I led astronomy and astrophysics activities and guided visitors during their visit in 2023 and I was part of the organisation team in 2024.

In 2021, I had the opportunity to take part in the Explor'Espace festival organised by the French Astronomy Association (AFA) in Montrouge.
I presented to the general public the student projects on aeronautics and astronautics of the student organisation Top Aéro.

I regularly take part in meetings between students or between students and pupils (at all levels).
This is an opportunity for me to share my knowledge and passion, but above all to answer questions about the orientation of scientific studies.
Orientation is a key issue for students.
In this context, I often go to forums or directly to schools to talk about this topic.
